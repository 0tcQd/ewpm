# EwPM
Lackluster package manager written in NodeJS originally written by me and someone else.


## What happened to the old repo?
The old repo was hosted on a seperate account and was a collaborative effort between me and someone else. Due to some circumstances and events, we broke ties, and the repo was deleted in the process.

## Why are you rehosting this?
I loved this project a lot, I spent a lot of my days and nights working on this tirelessly, and I'd hate for it to disappear forever.
